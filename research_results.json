    "answer": "Research findings for: what is quantum computing\n\nBased on the search results, here's a summary of the information:\n\nSource 1:\nTitle: What is Quantum Computing? - AWS\nContent: Quantum computing is a multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than on classical computers. The field of quantum computing includes hardware research and application development. Quantum computers are able to solve certain types of problems faster than classical computers by taking advantage of quantum mechanical effects, such as superposition and quantum interference. Some [...] Superconducting quantum computing is an implementation of a quantum computer in superconducting electronic circuits. Superconducting qubits are built with superconducting electric circuits that operate at cryogenic temperatures.\n\nPhotonic processors [...] A gate-based quantum computer is a device that takes input data and transforms it according to a predefined unitary operation. The operation is typically represented by a quantum circuit and is analogous to gate operations in traditional electronics. However, quantum gates are totally different from electronic gates.\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/quantum-computing/\n\nSource 2:\nTitle: Quantum computing - Wikipedia\nContent: A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster[a] than any modern \"classical\" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some [...] Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated as ‘n.quantum computing’) is an unconventional computing type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both, traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches [...] . If the first qubit is \n|\n0\n⟩\n, nothing is done to either qubit.\nIn summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.\nQuantum parallelism[edit]\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\n\nSource 3:\nTitle: What Is Quantum Computing? - IBM\nContent: What Is Quantum Computing? | IBM\nMy IBM Log in Subscribe   \nWhat is quantum computing?\nQuantum\n5 August 2024\nLink copied\nAuthors\n#### Josh SchneiderSenior Writer, IBM Blog\n#### Ian SmalleySenior Editorial Strategist\nWhat is quantum computing?\nQuantum computing is an emergent field of cutting-edge computer science harnessing the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers. [...] Quantum computers function similarly to classical computers, but instead of bits, quantum computing uses qubits. These qubits are special systems that act like subatomic particles made of atoms, superconducting electric circuits or other systems that data in a set of amplitudes applied to both 0 and 1, rather than just two states (0 or 1). This complicated quantum mechanical concept is called a superposition. Through a process called quantum entanglement, those amplitudes can apply to multiple [...] Quantum utility refers to any quantum computation that provides reliable, accurate solutions to problems that are beyond the reach of brute force classical computing quantum-machine simulators.
